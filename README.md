# Cowork McGill

## Virtual Coworking for McGill students

### What is this? 

Different people have different ways to maximize productivity. 

Cowork McGill is a platform where McGill students can try booking video sessions with another random McGill student to create a distraction-free cowork experience. It is restricted only to students with a valid McGill Zoom account. The website draws inspiration from [FocusMate](https://www.focusmate.com/), a site that randomly pairs people to 50-minute virtual coworking sessions. 

### How do I use it? 

Before entering the website, make sure you are logged into Zoom using [McGill's Single Sign-on (SSO)](https://mcgill.zoom.us/). 

**Authorize the app** <br>
To use the site, we only require permission to make and delete meetings on your behalf. We will not have access to user data such as your email address or your name.

**Book a session**<br>
When you book a session, you send in a request to be paired in the timeslot you have chosen.

**Check session status**<br>
If you are paired, you will see a link.
